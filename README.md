### About me(its in the file name right?)

I'm a QE Security Enineer at RedHat, working on openscap.
Openscap is an amazing project that ensures security on installation and during runtime of your servers.

Currently trying to become better in C and learn Rust.

### General info
On the left you can see my dog, Bruce. 
I find it calming to look at things we love during stressfull times, dogs are also a universal calming factor, so look at his cute face, he is incredible! 
You can look at his smile to relax.

Below you can find various projects of mine, IoT based and some data structures.
If you need any more info feel free to email me.
Keep in mind that some are in Greek and I'm currently trying to translate them(or maybe not).

If you see any mistakes or anything that I have missed please notify me! It's always great to improve.
