# Welcome to my corner! Please enjoy your stay :)

### General info
On the left you can see my dog, Bruce, I put his photo up since he makes my day after a stressful day of coding.
You can look at his smile to relax.

Below you can find various projects of mine, IoT based and some data structures.
If you need any more info feel free to email me.
Keep in mind that some are in Greek and I'm currently trying to translate them.

If you see any mistakes or anything that I have missed please notify me! It's always great to improve.
