Is it possible to escape Vim once you enter it? How?
<!--more-->

## A little story.
Once upon a time, as a young engineer I became trapped within the walls of Vim, panic overtook my thoughts.<br/>
Not event Ctrl+C worked, what should I do?<br/>
Fear not said a senior engineer, it's simple, just hit esc then : and last q and you can escape this hell.<br/>
I was out!!<br/>

## Is it worth?
Is it worth writing about it? The goal of this post is not to explain how to escape Vim but to write down some of my thoughts.<br/>
A lof of my fellow engineers write blog posts and spend too many resources to write tutorials that you can find on the web again and again.<br/>
If you google how to escape Vim you can find over 2.7 million results.<br/>
Instead we should promote good content that actually helped us learn and not oversaturate the search results.<br/>
To that end, you can find this [amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-txKSRn0qeA) by fireship, which explains a lot and can get you started.<br/>
