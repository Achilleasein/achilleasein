Welcome to my website, this is my first post!
<!--more-->

First and foremost thank you for comming here.
The idea behind this website is to showcase my work, share what I know an learn from everyone that visits it.
Knowledge should be shared and as Newton said: "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants"
To be a giant might be hard, but we can at least try to boost the knowledge of each other.

Below is a photo for my travels, it calms a lot, hope it helps you as well during a rough day.
