Hello everybody! Below there is a list for future plans.

## Planning Ahead

I have a few articles and tutorials planned for the future.
This is the list for them:

- Simple setup of github repos on w10.
- Mysql DB with python for GUI.
- Setting up Raspberry Pi for your local needs.
- My experience so far for setting up CV and preparing for interviews.

If you have any ideas or requests based on my work so far please contact me.
I'm always available!
