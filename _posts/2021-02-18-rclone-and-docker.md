How to avoid re-uploading your CV after each and every (small) change to your desired cloud storage.
<!--more-->

## A little story.
The idea began when I was applying to various companies for a job, every time there was a small incrementation to my CV based on the feedback received.
After getting bored of updating my CV in every cloud service that I was using(one drive, google drive, etc.), a decision was made to automated the procedure.
The first thought after that was: Is it worth automating?
Yes! because its a learning procedure and it will save me time in the future. <br/>
Now let's get on with the architecture!
