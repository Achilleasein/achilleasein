Hello there! (General Kenobi)

This is my website as you have guessed so far and my name is Achilleas Yfantis, you probably guessed that as well due to the title but nontheless it's polite to introduce one self.
My hope and goal for this website is to create a small corner for my projects and creations, meet new people and create communicate my knowledge and know-how to the world.

P.S.: The image on top calms me a lot, its from the beach Elafonissi in Crete, Greece. One of my favourite places on earth, do visit it some day!
