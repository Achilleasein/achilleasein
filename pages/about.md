Hello there! (General Kenobi)

This is my website, currently trying to improve it and write more things on it, hopefully things that will be usefull for other engineers, most probably juniors.

I'm a software engineer, currently studying more about containers and cloud, trying to learn as many technologies as possible in our ever changing world.
Currently studying GoLang and a lot of Python, they are essential for backend and the tech seems to shift towards that direction.

If you have any questions please do contact me!
I would be more than happy to meet new people and help in any way I can.

P.S.: The image on top calms me a lot, its from the beach Elafonissi in Crete, Greece. One of my favourite places on earth, do visit it some day!
